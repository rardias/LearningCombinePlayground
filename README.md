# _"Learning Combine"_ Playground
A simple playground created while learning Apple's (relatively) new framework, Combine. Shared it, since it may help others as well.

## Work in progress
The examples on this playground might be refined over time, and some new content will surely be added while my learning activities progress.

## Current themes included
* Foundation asynchronous interfaces
* What is Apple Combine?
* Key Concepts
* Revisiting Foundation + Combine
* Subjects
* Convenience Publishers + Subscribers
* Subscription lifecycle + memory management
* Common operators
    * Functional transformations
    * Collection/Math related
    * Adapting/chaining publisher
    * Combining operators
    * Timing control and scheduler/thread management
    * Debuging

## To do
* Include additional page with reference to articles, resources and other learning material
* Continue the learning journey with new topics
